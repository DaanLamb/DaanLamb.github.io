# My about page

This pages covers my [Interests](#interests), [Hobbies](#hobbies) and [Education](#education). Interests being related to various programming and data disciplines, and hobbies being anything else.

## Interests

Currently my largest interests lay in two areas: security and time series data.

Cyber security as a topic has been in the back of my mind throughout most of my academic career. Unfortunately because security and academia don't go well together, it had to stay in the back. Aside from the occasional optional course, the AI study does not focus much on security. But my first course on security helped my interest grow. Fortunately, AI has crept into the world of security more and more. Of course the clearest example is the AI for fraud detection. But my interest extend beyond the data layer of security. Especially to the more theoretical parts of the discipline.

My interest in time series data came about during my master thesis. Before that I dismissed it as something mostly used for financial modeling, which in fairness is true. During my thesis I was exposed to the intersection between time series data and signal processing/wave mechanics. This area of research is oriented towards data representations and their functionality.

## Hobbies

As for hobbies I tend to bounce between different things that peek my interests. I have played quite some sports. I used to play field hockey as well as the bit of tennis. More recently I have done some climbing, both bouldering as well as top rope. I have also tried out some sport through the university sports association.

Other than sports I like making things. This can be either making tools or cooking. I always liked cooking, and like many people the pandemic added a interest in baking and fermenting foods. [Brewing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link brewing.markdown%}) has also become a part of my love for cooking, mostly focused on ginger beer and regular beer.

During my time at the university I became active at Cover the study association for AI and CS. During the years I joined multiple committees. Some of them were more hobby than anything else, such as the sports committee. We just organized activities related to sports. Other such as the introductory committee provided more learning experiences as well. Organizing an introductory camp really teaches you how much work goes into any event. All of the committees were a combination of having fun and learning experiences. The balance of fun and learning differed quite a lot between the committees. Through the BHV committee I learned EHBO and BHV practices. Through the introductory committee, I learned to keep track of many moving parts. And through my year as treasurer of the association, I learned to work in a close knit team and to keep the books of an organization. I really enjoyed my time at the association, and as such, it is placed in the hobby section of this about section, and not in the following education section.

## Education

My eduction started with a VWO education at Gymnasium Celeanum in Zwolle. I took a combination of the NG and NT course packages, which is fairly common for students interested more in the exact sciences.

My university eduction started with a bachelor in Artificial Intelligence at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. The RUG provides a broad range of courses for the Artificial Intelligence. I mostly chose the courses more focused on programming and machine learning fundamentals. For my Bachelor thesis I chose a project in the direction of handwriting recognition. It was focused on a new way to binarize handrwiten documents. It employed conditional generative adversarial networks, a technique that has had its own rise in notoriety in the past years.

My graduate degree continued much of the same trend, a master in Artificial Intelligence at the RUG. I chose the computational intelligence and robotics track, because it aligned more with my interests. My graduate project exposed me to a lot of signal processing and wave theory, as it was related to lateral line detection.
