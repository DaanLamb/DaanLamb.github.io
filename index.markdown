## Some projects

- **[Steganography](https://github.com/DaanLamb/steganography)**
A project focused on brushing up my knowledge of image manipulation and cryptography in python. It uses a password or key to encode and decode a message in an image. For a detailed explanation, view the readme on github.

- **[Zero knowledge](https://github.com/DaanLamb/zeroKnowledge)**
A project that came about mostly to get me to work with c++ again, as it had been some time. It focused on a zero knowledge proof system. A nice addition was that it needed a random large prime. So it contains an implementation for a Miller-Rabin test of primality as well. For a thorough explanation view the readme on github.
